Hello and welcome to the world of typescript with me. We're going to open the door to a new world. In this class we're going to talk about what typescript is. In 2019, typescript is all kinds of hot, as I said before, on JS conference 2019,The typescript has also become a major issue, and it accounts for a large proportion. A lecturer from Microsoft, took out such a picture to express his point of view. We can see that Jeff Edward said a sentence in 2007, which is very famous. He said that anything can be done. Applications written in TypeScript will eventually be written in JavaScript.
